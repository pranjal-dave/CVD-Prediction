# Classification models for the prediction of cardiovascular diseases 
  

Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a range of diseases which affect the heart and the blood vessels connected to the heart. Some common CVDs are Heart Attack, Stroke, Arrhythmia. They are fatal and can cause death if not detected at an early stage. The World Health Organization (WHO) states CVDs as the number one cause of death worldwide.
With the advancement of Data Mining techniques, models can be created to predict the associated risk of the patient to have a CVD based on a particular set of symptoms. These models thrive on past data of patients and are relatively inexpensive. They can be used in lower economy countries where detection of CVD cases is not efficient due to lack of equipment. The accuracy of models increases with time, and they become more and more reliable.

## Dataset

I used the [Cardiovascular Disease dataset by Svetlana Ulianova](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) available on Kaggle. The dataset has 70000 instances and 13 attributes. There are three types of attributes in the dataset: Objective feature – factual information, Examination feature – results of the medical exam, Subjective feature – information given by the patient.

## Results

The data required pre-processing which is discussed in the code section. Following are the results of various classification models that were built to predict the outcome.
